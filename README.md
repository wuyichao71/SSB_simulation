## Coarse-Grained Simulation

The input files of Coarse-Grained simulations are saved in `CG/inp`.
`CG/inp/from_low_salt` directory has the input that charges are repartitioned from low [NaCl] concentration.
`CG/inp/from_high_salt` directory has the input that charges are repartitioned from high [NaCl] concentration.
The Coarse-Grained simulation can be performed in `CG/inp` directory with cafemol version 3.0.
