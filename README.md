## All-Atom Simuation

The representative trajectories of All Atom Simulation are saved at:  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12599313

## Coarse-Grained Simulation

The input files of Coarse-Grained simulations are saved in `CG/inp`.  
`CG/inp/from_low_salt` directory has the input that charges are repartitioned from low [NaCl] concentration.  
`CG/inp/from_high_salt` directory has the input that charges are repartitioned from high [NaCl] concentration.  
The Coarse-Grained simulation can be performed in `CG/inp` directory with cafemol version 3.0.  

The representative trajectories of Coarse Grained Simulation are saved at `CG_trajectory`.  
To reduce the space, the Coarse-Grained trajectories are converted to `.xtc` format.
